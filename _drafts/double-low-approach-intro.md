The metagame for jﾅ行eki for the 4-4 point has shifted significantly with the introduction of AI analysis, with the most prominent adaptation being the widespread use of the early 3-3 invasion.
But another prominent shift has been the increased willingness of players to ignore approaches to the 4-4 point (often in order to enclose a corner or invade a 3-3 themselves), naturally leading to a surge in the use of 4-4 point, double approach jﾅ行eki.
These jﾅ行eki can be rather complex to play at the kyu level: they are rife with variations and often feature both sides teetering precariously on an unstable equilibrium with mutually exposed weaknesses.
In this series we will attempt to provide kyu players with a working knowledge of the double low approach.
In the first article, we will look to provide a broad overview of the double low approach, focusing on the overall objectives that inform the selection of subsequent lines.

### Objectives and acceptable outcomes
