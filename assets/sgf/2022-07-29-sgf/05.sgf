Locally this is a loss for White as Black is looking to play both the bottom and right sides, while White is not quite settled. White needs to make up for this by attacking either of Black's two sides while they have yet to fully settle, but this is not necessarily an easy strategy to execute and will also depend on the rest of the board.]))
