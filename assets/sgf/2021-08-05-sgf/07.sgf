Black has mishandled the positions in the top left and right. White has two extremely strong groups which all but forbid an invasion or reduction of the top side, and the position on the right is strong as well. Meanwhile, Black has yet to claim much serious territory, and needs to shake up the state of the game.]AP[Sabaki:0.52.0]CA[UTF-8];B[jp]C[Aware of its disadvantage and the general futility of approaching the White stones, Black adopts the strategy "go big or go home." The idea is to try to claim as much of the bottom and right sides with as few moves as possible. Normally Black needs additional stones at A through E to claim most of this territory, which is the move debt for Black in this strategy. Black's goal is to claim this territory while omitting as many of these moves as possible, and thereby building faster than what has already been built on the top and right. Then White will either be forced to invade or reduce deeply, inviting attack, or allow Black's greed to go unpunished.]LB[dp:C][ek:D][gp:E][lp:A][ro:B];W[lp];B[nq];W[mo];B[on];W[om];B[nn];W[nm];B[mn];W[ln];B[lm];W[mm];B[kn];W[lo];B[km]C[KataGo winrate: B 47.5%, W+0.5.

In a stroke of luck, White misplays the invasion, and Black (unaware that the game has evened out to this degree) plays high and thick to continue its strategy. The more stones like this Black can play, the more likely it is that Black will be able to omit moves like A - C.]LB[dp:A][gk:C][gp:B];W[po];B[op];W[qp];B[qq];W[ro];B[hh]LB[dp:B][ek:C][gp:A]C[KataGo winrate: B 46.2%,  W+0.9.

Again, this move is clearly too far away to actually enclose the space Black wants, but it is ultimately trying to omit moves like A - C. White will soon need to invade or Black will have effectively gained three stones with no punishment, far more than enough to overcome Black's initial deficit of ~8.0 points.];W[ik]C[A shallow invasion/reduction; White probably could afford a deeper invasion such as A or B, because these spaces are still quite open as a consequence of Black's refusal to reinforce directly.]LB[cl:A][hp:B];B[kj]C[Black goes on the attack. The intent here is not to kill White's invasion, as this is still quite difficult. Black's goal is to get additional strength near the marked points, all in an effort to avoid paying its debts at A - C.]LB[dp:B][ek:A][gp:C]TR[gk][gl][hm][im];W[kk];B[lk];W[jj];B[kl];W[ki];B[jk];W[ii];B[hj];W[jl];B[kk];W[ij];B[hl];W[hk];B[gl]LB[gk:A]C[KataGo winrate: B 58.0%, B+1.4.

Black's plan is working well, but this move was timid: Black can afford to block at A, and then the plan would be complete.];W[gk];B[il]LB[fk:A]C[Also a bit timid: could have been at A.];W[ej];B[fk];W[fj];B[gj];W[ek];B[fl]C[KataGo winrate: B 86.5%, B+11.8.

Black's plan has succeeded admirably. Although the weakness at the triangled point and some general bad shape mean that White's stones still have a little life in them, overall Black has achieved the desired outcome of omitting A and likely B, thereby effectively gaining two free stones. White can still make a few things happen in the lower left corner, but now Black has too much support outside for White to expect a major reversal (a good example of why you should probe enclosures early). In the meantime White has the burden of taking care of the squared stones as well - even if White can make something happen on the bottom side, it is all for naught if the squared stones die as they stand, because then Black would have managed to avoid paying its debt on the left side rather than the bottom. ]TR[dh]LB[dp:B][gp:A]SQ[ej][ek][fj])
