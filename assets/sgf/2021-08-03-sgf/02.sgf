(;SZ[19]AB[pq]PL[W]C[If White's direction of play is toward the bottom side, then there are roughly three different ways to accomplish this as a corner approach: approaching from the bottom side (A or similar), the high approach into the avalanche (B), or the 4-4 attachment (C).]AP[Sabaki:0.52.0]CA[UTF-8]LB[mp:A][po:B][pp:C](;W[mp];B[po]C[This is most commonly seen in the context of a Chinese-style fuseki by Black, where Black typically has the top right corner and a stone near the marked point. In that case White might want to avoid a standard approach due to the presence of Black support, and might also want to preemptively counteract the buildup of Black influence in this area. However, otherwise this exchange tends to favor Black locally, as the corner enclosure is quite big and White's stone isn't necessarily doing a whole lot just yet.]TR[qk])(;W[po]C[Normally AI finds it hard to resist A, as AI likes to get a decently-sized corner in this position. If Black insists on playing the bottom side first then there exist multiple options for that such as B, but this does open up the corner to White.]LB[np:B][qo:A];B[qo];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq]C[White successfully gets to play the bottom side, and Black now has a few options. If Black opts for A, B or C, then White can finish off this sequence pretty safely and easily.
