White finally fixes its weakness at A and Black gets the big move at B in exchange. As Black managed to play two sides while White's group still hasn't fully stabilized, the outcome in the top left favors Black locally. In essence, Black traded a locally suboptimal position in the bottom left for getting a favorable position in the top left.

White has fixed its weakness at A and successfully invades the top side. Note White's willingness to treat the bottom left corner lightly - only after 4 uncontested moves does KataGo consider this corner Black territory, and there is still aji left for White to exploit later. White can next look to pressure Black's stones in the top and top left, or invade the bottom side.]LB[ed:A]))
