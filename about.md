### Acknowledgements

* The information in the articles is synthesized from a variety of sources. The most important ones are:
	* Jin Dong-gyu, Korean 7p. His [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClyJG8qHaU2QxTFrlBrc3hg) is the single most important resource for this site.
	* [Sensei's Library](https://senseis.xmp.net/).
* This website was created using Jekyll. The theme is [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). Credit for the theme goes to [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo).
* The embedded sgf viewers are [BesoGo](https://yewang.github.io/besogo/) by [yewang](https://github.com/yewang).
* The KataGo analyses are done using the [20 block network](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/releases/tag/v1.4.5) and with the help of [Katrain](https://github.com/sanderland/katrain). Due to my fairly basic hardware at the moment, playouts for the analyses are fairly limited - anywhere from a few hundred to around 1k playouts before finalizing the winrate and score estimates. Settings are Japanese rules with 6.5 komi.
